description: 'The provided module named `alu` functions as an Arithmetic Logic Unit
  (ALU) for an 8-bit accumulator-based architecture. The ALU supports various operations
  defined by a 4-bit opcode, which includes basic arithmetic operations like addition,
  subtraction, bitwise AND, OR, XOR, as well as shift and rotate instructions. Specifically,
  the ALU takes two 8-bit inputs, `A` and `B`, and an opcode that dictates the operation
  to perform, producing an 8-bit output `Y`. The operations are: addition (`0000`),
  subtraction (`0001`), bitwise AND (`0010`), bitwise OR (`0011`), bitwise XOR (`0100`),
  left shift `B` by 4 bits (`0101`), left shift `A` by 1 (`0110`), right shift `A`
  by 1 (`0111`), rotate `A` left (`1000`), rotate `A` right (`1001`), decrement `A`
  by 1 (`1010`), bitwise NOT of `A` (`1011`), with a default case returning zero.
  This ALU is designed to operate in conjunction with a set of instructions that include
  both immediate and variable-data operand instructions, control/status register manipulations,
  fixed control, and branching instructions, as well as other data manipulation instructions.
  The opcode expansion to 5 bits in the comment appears to be a discrepancy as the
  actual code and described ISA utilize a 4-bit opcode. The instructions cover a wide
  range of operations from loading and storing in memory, arithmetic operations based
  on memory contents or immediate values, to more complex branching and control flow
  operations. This comprehensive set of instructions and the ALU''s capabilities allow
  for versatile programming and control within this 8-bit accumulator-based architecture.'
