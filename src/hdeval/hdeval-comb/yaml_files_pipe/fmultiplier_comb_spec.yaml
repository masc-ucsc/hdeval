description: Implement the `fmultiplier_comb` module, create a module with two 32-bit
  inputs, `a` and `b`, representing single-precision IEEE 754 floating-point numbers,
  and a 32-bit output `z` for the multiplication result. Begin by extracting the sign,
  exponent, and mantissa from each input, remembering to include an implicit '1' for
  the mantissa of normalized numbers. Address special cases such as zero, infinity,
  and NaN by checking the exponent and mantissa values. Calculate the result exponent
  by adding the input exponents and adjusting for the bias. Multiply the mantissas,
  normalize the product, and apply simplified rounding. Use combinational logic to
  set `z` based on these calculations, handling NaN, infinity, and zero appropriately,
  and combining the sign, exponent, and mantissa for other cases. Ensure the module
  operates without clock signals, producing the output directly from the inputs.
interface: module fmultiplier_comb(input [31:0] a, input [31:0] b, output reg [31:0]
  z);
