description: '`SHA512SIG0H` which is a part of the SHA-512 cryptographic hash function.
  The function takes three parameters: rs2, rs1, and rd, which are indices of source
  registers and a destination register. This function performs a series of bitwise
  manipulations on the 64-bit values contained in registers rs1 and rs2, and then
  stores the result in the destination register rd. The core functions are as follows:
  Bitwise Shifts and Rotations on rs1: It applies three different right shift functions
  on the value from rs1: Shift right by 1 bit (X(rs1) >> 1). Shift right by 7 bits
  (X(rs1) >> 7). Shift right by 8 bits (X(rs1) >> 8). Bitwise Shifts on rs2: It also
  performs two left shift functions on the value from rs2: Shift left by 31 bits (X(rs2)
  << 31). Shift left by 24 bits (X(rs2) << 24). Combination of Results: The results
  of these five functions (three from rs1 and two from rs2) are combined using the
  XOR (^) function. Store the Result: The final result of these functions is then
  sign-extended (EXTS()) to ensure proper bit length and stored in the destination
  register rd.'
