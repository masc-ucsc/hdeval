description: 'Defines a modular approach to performing floating-point division in
  a digital system, focusing on the `division` module''s orchestration of the division
  process with submodules for specific arithmetic tasks. The `division` module inputs
  two 32-bit floating-point numbers, `a` as the dividend and `b` as the divisor, and
  outputs a 32-bit result `res`, representing the quotient, along with an `exception`
  flag for special conditions like division by zero or operations with NaN or infinity.
  The process includes normalization of the divisor for precision, iterative refinement
  of the quotient using submodules `Multiplication`, `Addition_Subtraction`, and `Iteration`,
  and final adjustment of the quotient based on the dividend''s exponent. The `Multiplication`
  submodule performs floating-point multiplication, addressing sign determination,
  normalization, rounding, and exceptional conditions. The `Addition_Subtraction`
  submodule conducts floating-point addition or subtraction, based on a control signal,
  including operand alignment, operation execution, and result normalization. The
  `Iteration` submodule refines the quotient iteratively through a sequence of multiplication
  and addition/subtraction steps, using a specific algorithm for division. These components
  interact to progressively refine the quotient, ensuring the result is correctly
  scaled to the original dividend''s exponent. This description emphasizes the division
  module''s role in coordinating the division process, the iterative refinement technique
  for accuracy, and the involvement of each submodule in achieving an IEEE 754 compliant
  floating-point division operation. 1. **Normalization**: Initially, the division
  normalizes the divisor `b` to enhance the precision of the division. This involves
  calculating the shift needed to adjust `b`''s exponent to a predefined value, ensuring
  the divisor is suitably scaled for the division operation.2. **Iterative Refinement**:
  The core of the division operation is iterative refinement, employing a Newton-Raphson
  method or similar to converge upon an accurate quotient. This process is realized
  through repeated applications of `Multiplication`, `Addition_Subtraction`, and `Iteration`
  submodules:   - **Multiplication**: Takes two 32-bit floating-point numbers and
  performs multiplication, adjusting for the signs of the operands, normalizing the
  product, and handling special cases like overflow and underflow. It is crucial for
  both adjusting the initial divisor and in each iteration step to refine the quotient.   -
  **Addition_Subtraction**: Capable of executing addition or subtraction on floating-point
  numbers, this module aligns the operands based on their exponents, carries out the
  desired operation, and normalizes the result. It''s invoked to adjust intermediate
  values during iterative refinement.   - **Iteration**: This submodule encapsulates
  the iterative step of the refinement process, applying a combination of multiplication
  and addition/subtraction to improve the quotient''s accuracy. It represents a mathematical
  approach to division, with each iteration designed to get closer to the accurate
  quotient. 3. **Exponent Adjustment**: After completing the necessary iterations,
  the division module adjusts the final quotient''s exponent. This adjustment ensures
  the quotient is correctly scaled, taking into account the original exponent of the
  dividend and the normalization shifts applied throughout the division process. 4.
  **Exception Handling**: The module includes logic to detect and signal exceptional
  conditions, such as division by zero and operations involving NaN or infinity, compliant
  with IEEE 754 standards. The division module showcases a comprehensive approach
  to floating-point division, leveraging the IEEE 754 format and iterative refinement
  for accuracy. Each submodule plays a pivotal role in achieving the precise quotient,
  emphasizing the modular design''s flexibility and efficiency in handling floating-point
  arithmetic operations within digital systems.'
