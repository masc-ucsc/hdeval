description: 'Design a module that accepts a 4-bit binary number as input and outputs
  the corresponding 2''s complement of that number. The goal is to calculate the 2''s
  complement of a binary number. The input: bin_input and the output: [3:0]complement_output.'
interface: module assign_twos_complement (input  [3:0] bin_input, output [3:0] complement_output);
