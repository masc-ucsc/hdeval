description: Implement a `double_adder_combinational` module for adding two 64-bit
  IEEE 754 double-precision floating-point numbers, start by defining two 64-bit inputs,
  `input_a` and `input_b`, and a 64-bit output, `output_z`. Decompose each input into
  a sign bit, an 11-bit exponent, and a 52-bit mantissa, adding an implicit '1' to
  the front of each mantissa to represent normalized numbers. Handle special cases
  such as NaN, infinity, and zero based on IEEE 754 rules. For the arithmetic operation,
  align the mantissas by shifting based on the exponent difference, then add or subtract
  them depending on the signs. Normalize the result if necessary by shifting the mantissa
  and adjusting the exponent. Construct the output from the result sign (assumed to
  be the same as `input_a`'s sign for simplicity), the adjusted exponent, and the
  normalized mantissa, omitting the implicit '1'. Note that this implementation simplifies
  certain aspects, such as rounding and precise handling of edge cases.
interface: module double_adder_combinational(input [63:0] input_a, input [63:0] input_b,
  output reg [63:0] output_z);
