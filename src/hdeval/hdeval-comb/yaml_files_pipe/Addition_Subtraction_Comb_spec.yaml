description: 'Defines a module named `Addition_Subtraction_Comb` that performs floating-point
  addition or subtraction on two 32-bit inputs based on the IEEE 754 standard. Inputs
  and Outputs: It takes two 32-bit inputs `a` and `b`, which are the floating-point
  numbers to be added or subtracted. The `add_sub_signal` input determines the operation:
  if it''s `1`, the module performs addition; otherwise, it performs subtraction.
  The output `res` is a 32-bit number representing the result of the operation. The
  `exception` output signals an exceptional condition, such as overflow or underflow.
  the `Addition_Subtraction_Comb` module encapsulates the complexities of floating-point
  addition and subtraction, adhering to the IEEE 754 standard, and includes steps
  like decomposition, alignment, arithmetic operation, normalization, and result construction,
  ensuring accurate and standard-compliant results.'
interface: module Addition_Subtraction_Comb(input [31:0] a, input [31:0] b, input
  add_sub_signal, output [31:0] res, output exception);
