description: The module `AddSubUnit` acts as a combinational logic unit within a vector
  processor, designed to perform either addition or subtraction based on a control
  signal. It accepts a 64-bit `recv_msg` input, divided into two 32-bit operands (`operand1`
  and `operand2`), and an `operation` signal that determines the operation mode (addition
  or subtraction). The `recv_val` input indicates the validity of the operands, and
  the unit outputs a 32-bit `send_msg` as the result. The `recv_rdy` output, which
  signals the unit's readiness to receive new data, is linked to the `send_rdy` input,
  ensuring flow control between units. The result's validity is indicated by the `send_val`
  output, which mirrors the `recv_val` input state. This setup guarantees that the
  output result, `send_msg`, is immediately updated based on the current inputs and
  operation mode, achieving a one-cycle latency for its operations. The module seamlessly
  integrates into the vector processor's pipeline, providing efficient arithmetic
  operations essential for data processing tasks.
