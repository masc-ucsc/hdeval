description: Design module named isa_to_alu_opcode that translates 8-bit ISA instructions
  into 4-bit ALU opcodes for an 8-bit accumulator-based microcontroller, taking an
  8-bit input isa_instr and outputting a 4-bit alu_opcode; the translation process
  involves specific 8-bit instructions directly mapping to ALU opcodes for operations
  like shifting, rotating, decrementing, clearing, and inverting, while subsets of
  4-bit and 3-bit patterns in the instruction's most significant bits define default
  and other operations like add, subtract, bitwise AND, OR, XOR, with unmatched patterns
  defaulting to a specific operation, enabling the microcontroller to correctly interpret
  and execute a broad range of instructions by translating them into specific ALU
  operations based on current instruction patterns.
interface: module isa_to_alu_opcode (input [7:0] isa_instr, output reg [3:0] alu_opcode);
