description: 'Please implement the `neuron_block` module, define a module with a set
  of 8-bit inputs for the neuron''s parameters, including current potential (`voltage_potential_i`),
  thresholds (`pos_threshold_i`, `neg_threshold_i`), leak value (`leak_value_i`),
  weights (`weight_type1_i` to `weight_type4_i`), weight selector (`weight_select_i`),
  resets (`pos_reset_i`, `neg_reset_i`), and an enable signal (`enable_i`). The module
  should have an 8-bit output `new_potential_o` for the updated potential and a binary
  output `spike_o` to indicate spiking. Use combinational logic to select the weight
  based on `weight_select_i` and calculate the new potential by adding the selected
  weight to the current potential and subtracting the leak value, taking care to manage
  overflow and underflow. Check if the new potential crosses any thresholds to determine
  spiking behavior and potential resets. Ensure the neuron only updates when enabled,
  and resets its outputs when not enabled. Inputs: The module should have several
  8-bit inputs, each representing different parameters of the neuron: `voltage_potential_i`:
  The current voltage potential of the neuron. `pos_threshold_i`: The positive threshold
  voltage at which the neuron fires a spike. `neg_threshold_i`: The negative threshold
  voltage at which the neuron might inhibit firing. `leak_value_i`: The value representing
  the neuron''s leakage, reducing its potential over time. `weight_type1_i` to `weight_type4_i`:
  Four different types of synaptic weights that can be applied to the input signal.
  `weight_select_i`: A selector for choosing which of the four weight types to apply.
  `pos_reset_i`: The voltage potential to reset to after a positive spike. `neg_reset_i`:
  The voltage potential to reset to after dropping below the negative threshold. `enable_i`:
  An enable signal that allows the neuron to update its state. Outputs: `new_potential_o`:
  The updated voltage potential of the neuron. `spike_o`: A binary output indicating
  whether the neuron has fired a spike.'
