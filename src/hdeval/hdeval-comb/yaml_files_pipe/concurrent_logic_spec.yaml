description: 'Implement a module that has two input signals ''a'' and ''b''. Produce
  an output ''o1'' that represents the AND operation and an output ''o2'' that represents
  the OR operation. Both operations should be calculated concurrently. The inputs:
  a, b and the outputs: [0:0]o1, o2.'
interface: module concurrent_logic (input  a, input b, output o1, output o2);
