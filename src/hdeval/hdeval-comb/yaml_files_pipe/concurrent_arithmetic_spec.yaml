description: 'Implement a module that computes both the sum and difference of two
  4-bit inputs ''a'' and ''b'' concurrently, producing two 4-bit outputs ''sum'' and
  ''diff''. The inputs: [3:0]a, [3:0]b and the outputs: [3:0]sum, [3:0]diff.'
interface: module concurrent_arithmetic (input  [3:0] a, input  [3:0] b, output [3:0]
  sum, output [3:0] diff);
