description: 'Design a module that implements a variable logical right shift. The
  shift amount is set by 5 bit input bus ''shift_n_i'' and the value being right shifted
  is a 32 bit input bus ''val_i''. The result is also a 32 bit bus output named ''result_o''.
  Input(s): shift_n_i[4:0], val_i[31:0]. Output(s): result_o[31:0].'
interface: module variable_logical_rightshift (input [4:0] shift_n_i, input [31:0]
  val_i, output [31:0] result_o);
