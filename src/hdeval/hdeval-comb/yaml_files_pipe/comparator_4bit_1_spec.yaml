description: Design a 4 bit comparator which takes unsigned inputs A[3:0] and B[3:0]
  and has output Y[1:0]. If A is greater than B then Y should be 1, if A is less than
  B then Y should be 3, and if they are equal then Y should be 0.
interface: module comparator_4bit_1 (input [3:0] A, input [3:0] B, output signed [1:0]
  Y );
