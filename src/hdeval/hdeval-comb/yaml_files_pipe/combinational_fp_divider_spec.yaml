description: 'The module, named `combinational_fp_divider`, is designed to perform
  floating-point division on two 32-bit inputs (`input_a` and `input_b`), producing
  a 32-bit output (`output_z`). The module is structured to handle the division in
  a combinational manner, meaning it does not rely on clock cycles and produces the
  output directly from the current inputs. Sign, Exponent, and Mantissa Extraction:
  Each input is decomposed into its sign bit, 8-bit exponent, and 23-bit mantissa
  (significand), following the IEEE 754 standard for single-precision floating-point
  numbers. Simplified Division: The division is greatly simplified, ignoring many
  complexities of real floating-point division, such as precision, rounding, and range
  adjustments. The division uses an extended dividend (by appending 24 zeros to `norm_mant_a`)
  for increased precision, and the quotient is directly calculated from `norm_mant_a`
  divided by `norm_mant_b`. Mantissa Normalization: For normalized numbers (non-zero
  exponent), an implicit ''1'' is prepended to the mantissa, while for denormalized
  numbers (zero exponent), a ''0'' is prepended. This step ensures that the division
  operation has a consistent starting point.  The sign of the result is the XOR of
  the input signs, and the exponent is calculated by subtracting the exponent of B
  from that of A and then normalizing to the bias (127 for IEEE 754 single-precision).
  Special Case Outputs: The module adjusts the output for special cases like NaN,
  infinity, division by zero, and zero results, setting the output to predefined values
  for these conditions. Overflow and Underflow: It detects overflow (when the calculated
  exponent exceeds the representable range) and underflow (when the result is too
  small to be represented) and sets the output to infinity or zero, respectively.
  Normal Result: For a normal result, the module constructs the output from the calculated
  sign, exponent, and the most significant bits of the division result (after normalization
  and without rounding).'
