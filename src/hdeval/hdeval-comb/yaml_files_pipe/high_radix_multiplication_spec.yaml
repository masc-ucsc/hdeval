description: 'Implement the `high_radix_multiplication` module, create a module with
  two 16-bit inputs, `x` and `y`, for the operands, and a 32-bit output `out_o` for
  the product. Begin by computing the two''s complement of `x` (`inv_x`) for generating
  negative partial products. Use a generate block with a loop to iterate over 2-bit
  segments of `y`, generating partial products according to the high-radix Booth''s
  algorithm. Store these partial products in an array products. For each segment of
  `y`, generate a partial product based on the value of the 2-bit segment: `0` for
  `00` or `11`, `x` for `01`, and `-x` (`inv_x`) for `10`, shifting each partial product
  left by twice the iteration index to align it properly. `Sum` the partial products
  in pairs and store the intermediate sums in an array `sum`. Continue summing the
  intermediate sums until you obtain the final product, which should be assigned to
  `out_o`. Ensure that each step accounts for the sign and position of the partial
  products to accurately represent the multiplication result.'
