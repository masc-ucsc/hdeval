description: Implement a 4-bit parity generator. parity_generator which calculates
  the parity of a 4-bit input. The input, named data_in, is 4 bits wide. The output,
  named parity_out, is a single bit representing the even parity of the input. The
  even parity is generated such that the total number of '1' bits in the combined
  input and output is even, where the output is high if the number of 1's in the input
  is even, and low if the number of 1's in the input is odd.
interface: module parity_generator (input [3:0] data_in, output reg parity_out);
