description: We're making some code which verifies that our 4-bit segment address
  is within safe bounds as defined by some 8-bit T/F encoded values (SEGEXE_H and
  SEGEXE_L for the high and low 8 values respectively - '1' means it is safe). Can
  you write me a combinational module which takes in the 4-bit segment, the SEGEXE
  values, and returns a one-bit illegal_segment_address if the corresponding SEGEXE
  value is 0? the module name is `SegmentCheck`, `illegal_segment_address` will be
  set to 1 when the corresponding bit in the `SEGEXE` input is 0.
interface: module SegmentCheck( input wire [3:0] seg_addr, input wire [7:0] SEGEXE_H,
  input wire [7:0] SEGEXE_L, output reg illegal_segment_address);
