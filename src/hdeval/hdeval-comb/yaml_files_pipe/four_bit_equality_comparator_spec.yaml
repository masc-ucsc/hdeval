description: 'Design a 4-bit comparator  that will compare two 4-bit numbers, `A`
  and `B` and set output `equality` a "1" if they are equal, a "0" if they are not
  equal, and output from `val_o` which number is larger (in the case of equality,
  should still output the value). Inputs: A[3:0], B[3:0]. Outputs: equality, val_o[3:0]'
interface: module four_bit_equality_comparator (input [3:0] A, input [3:0] B,  output
  [3:0] val_o,  output equality);
