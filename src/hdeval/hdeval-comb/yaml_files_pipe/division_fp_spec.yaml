description: 'Defines a floating-point division operation within a digital system,
  where the `division_fp` module acts as the top-level module. This module orchestrates
  the division process by coordinating various submodules, each responsible for a
  specific aspect of floating-point arithmetic. Below is a detailed description of
  the `division` module and its relationship with the submodules: Top-Level Module:
  division: Functionality: The division module performs floating-point division of
  two 32-bit inputs, `a` (dividend) and `b` (divisor), to produce a 32-bit result
  `res`, which represents the quotient. The module also outputs an `exception` flag
  to indicate special conditions like division by zero or operations involving NaN
  (Not a Number) or infinity, as per IEEE 754 standards. Submodules Interaction: The
  division process begins by normalizing the divisor to enhance the precision of the
  division operation. This involves adjusting the exponent of the divisor and aligning
  it for the division process. The module uses iterative refinement techniques, potentially
  involving submodules like `Multiplication`, `Addition_Subtraction`, and `Iteration`,
  to converge on an accurate quotient. After completing the iterations, the module
  adjusts the final quotient based on the original exponent of the dividend to ensure
  the result is correctly scaled. Submodules: Multiplication: Functionality: Performs
  floating-point multiplication between two inputs. It handles sign determination,
  product normalization, rounding, and checks for overflow, underflow, and exceptional
  conditions. Relation to `division`: Used within the division process for iterative
  refinement of the quotient and initial normalization of the divisor. Addition_Subtraction:
  Functionality: Capable of performing either addition or subtraction on two floating-point
  numbers, based on a control signal. It aligns the operands based on their exponents,
  performs the operation, and normalizes the result. Relation to `division`: Employed
  to adjust the intermediate values during the division''s iterative refinement steps
  and for final result adjustment. Iteration: Functionality: Conducts a series of
  operations involving multiplication and addition/subtraction to refine the quotient
  iteratively. This module likely encapsulates a specific mathematical approach or
  algorithm tailored for division. Relation to `division`: Acts as a critical component
  in the iterative process to converge on the final quotient. The division module
  may invoke this submodule multiple times, each time with updated operands to progressively
  refine the quotient. priority_encoder (If used within division) Functionality: Normalizes
  a significand by shifting it until the MSB is 1, adjusting the exponent accordingly.
  This is essential for maintaining the floating-point number in a normalized form.
  Relation to `division`: While not explicitly called within the division module from
  the provided code snippet, a priority encoder is typically used in floating-point
  operations to normalize results after arithmetic operations. It might be utilized
  within Multiplication, Addition_Subtraction, or directly in division to normalize
  intermediate values or the final result. Please make sure that implement all modules
  and the top-module will be the first one.'
