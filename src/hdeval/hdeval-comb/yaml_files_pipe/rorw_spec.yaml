description: 'rorw(Rotate Right Word (Register)): I need a function that performs
  a rotate right on the least-significant word of `rs1` by the amount in least-significant
  5 bits of `rs2`. The resultant word is sign-extended by copying bit 31 to all of
  the more-significant bits. The result will be saved in `rd`.'
interface: module rorw( input [31:0] rs1, input [31:0] rs2, output reg [31:0] rd);
