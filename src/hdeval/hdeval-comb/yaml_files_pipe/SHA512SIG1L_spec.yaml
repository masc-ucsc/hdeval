description: '`SHA512SIG1L` which forms part of the SHA-512 cryptographic hash algorithm.
  This function targets two source registers (rs2 and rs1) and a destination register
  (rd), performing a series of bitwise functions on 64-bit values from rs1 and rs2,
  then storing the resulting value in rd. Key steps include: Bitwise functions on
  rs1: Left shift the value from rs1 by 3 bits (X(rs1) << 3). Right shift the value
  from rs1 by 6 bits (X(rs1) >> 6). Right shift the value from rs1 by 19 bits (X(rs1)
  >> 19). Bitwise functions on rs2: Right shift the value from rs2 by 29 bits (X(rs2)
  >> 29). Left shift the value from rs2 by 26 bits (X(rs2) << 26). Left shift the
  value from rs2 by 13 bits (X(rs2) << 13). Combining Results: The results from the
  above functions on both rs1 and rs2 are combined using XOR (^) functions. Store
  the Result: The combined result is sign-extended (EXTS()) to adjust for any sign
  bit extension required and stored in the destination register rd.'
interface: module SHA512SIG1L( input [63:0] rs1, input [63:0] rs2, output reg [63:0]
