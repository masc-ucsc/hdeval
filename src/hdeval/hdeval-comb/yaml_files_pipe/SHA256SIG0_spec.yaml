description: 'sha256sig0: a specific function named `SHA256SIG0`, which takes two
  arguments: `rs1` and `rd`. These arguments are intended to be register indices where
  rs1 is the source register and rd is the destination register. The function performed
  by this function is part of the SHA-256 hashing algorithm, specifically the(sigma_0)
  transformation. The function works as follows: It reads a 32-bit input value from
  the source register rs1. It applies the (sigma_0) function to this input. The (sigma_0)
  function is defined as a combination of right rotations and right shifts on the
  input value: Right rotate the input value by 7 bits (ror32(inb, 7)). Right rotate
  the input value by 18 bits (ror32(inb, 18)). Right shift the input value by 3 bits
  (inb >> 3). The results of these functions are then XOR''d together to produce the
  final result. This final result is then extended to the appropriate size (if necessary)
  and written back to the destination register rd. The function concludes by signaling
  successful execution with RETIRE_SUCCESS.'
interface: module SHA256SIG0( input [31:0] rs1, output reg [31:0] rd);
