description: The `fp_multiplier` module performs floating-point multiplication following
  IEEE 754 single-precision format. It takes two 32-bit inputs `a` and `b`, representing
  floating-point numbers, and outputs a 32-bit result `y`. The operation decomposes
  inputs into sign, exponent, and mantissa components. The sign of the output is the
  XOR of the input signs, reflecting that the result is negative if exactly one of
  the inputs is negative. The mantissas are extended with an implicit leading `1`
  and multiplied, generating a 48-bit product to handle overflow. The output exponent
  is calculated by summing the input exponents, adjusting for the bias (127), and
  correcting based on the multiplication result's leading bit. Normalization is applied
  as necessary, and rounding is managed by considering significant bits beyond the
  mantissa's 23-bit capacity. Special cases, including operations involving infinity,
  NaN, and zero, adhere to IEEE 754 rules. NaN is represented with an exponent of
  `8'hFF` and a mantissa of `23'h400000`. Rounding incorporates the `r` and `sticky_bit`
  signals for precision. The module dynamically adjusts for negative exponent scenarios
  and assembles the output `y` by combining the calculated sign, exponent, and mantissa,
  ensuring compliance with floating-point arithmetic standards.
