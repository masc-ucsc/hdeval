# Compile Conversation

**User:**
Can you implement the described Module in Verilog using purely combinational logic:
Design a 1-bit full adder. The inputs are: [0:0]a, [0:0]b, [0:0]cin and the outputs are: [0:0]sum, [0:0]cout.
Please respond with only valid program syntax. Set input/output names exactly as stated, avoid abbreviation. Please do not provide any additional English explanation, short comments in the code are allowed.
The module declaration is: module full_adder(input [0:0] a,input [0:0] b,input [0:0] cin,output [0:0] sum,output [0:0] cout);


**Assistant:**
```verilog
module full_adder(input [0:0] a, input [0:0] b, input [0:0] cin, output [0:0] sum, output [0:0] cout);
  assign sum = a ^ b ^ cin;  // Sum is XOR of a, b, and cin
  assign cout = (a & b) | (b & cin) | (a & cin);  // Carry out is majority function of a, b, and cin
endmodule
```

**System:**
Success!
