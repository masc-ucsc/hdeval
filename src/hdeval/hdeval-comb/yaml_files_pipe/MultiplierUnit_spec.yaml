description: "I am implementing a Multiplier Unit with the following specifications:\
  \ \n- recv_msg: A 64-bit input divided into two parts; the first 32 bits are the\
  \ first operand, and the second 32 bits are the second operand for the multiplication\
  \ operation. \n- recv_val: A signal indicating that the operands provided are valid\
  \ for processing. \n- recv_rdy: A signal that denotes the Multiplier Unit's readiness\
  \ to receive new operands, directly tied to the send_rdy signal to indicate the\
  \ unit is ready to receive new data when the next unit is ready to receive the result.\
  \ \n- send_msg: A 32-bit output that holds the product of the multiplication of\
  \ the two operands. This output is determined in a purely combinational manner,\
  \ ensuring no latches are inferred in the design. \n- send_val: A signal that is\
  \ set to indicate the result of the multiplication is valid and ready to be sent\
  \ out, which mirrors the state of send_rdy to synchronize the output validity with\
  \ the readiness of the next unit in the data chain. \n- send_rdy: An input signal\
  \ indicating that the downstream unit is prepared to accept the result of the multiplication.\
  \ The design ensures that the Multiplier Unit operates in a flow-controlled manner,\
  \ producing outputs only when they can be accepted downstream, thereby facilitating\
  \ a smooth data processing flow without bottlenecks. \nThis description ensures\
  \ the Multiplier Unit is implemented as a purely combinational logic design, with\
  \ direct assignments for send_msg, recv_rdy, and send_val based on the inputs and\
  \ the readiness signal from the next unit (send_rdy), effectively preventing latch\
  \ inference and adhering to the requirements for a combinational logic implementation."
interface: module MultiplierUnit (input logic [63:0] recv_msg, input logic recv_val,
  output logic recv_rdy, output logic [31:0] send_msg, output logic send_val, input
  logic send_rdy);
