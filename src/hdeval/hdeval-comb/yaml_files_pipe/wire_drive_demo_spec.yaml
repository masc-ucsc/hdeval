description: 'Create a module that showcases a wire ''w'' being driven by two continuous
  assignments. The inputs: [0:0]a, [0:0]b, [0:0]sel and the outputs: [0:0]w, [0:0]w1,
  [0:0]w2. ''w1'' is the bitwise AND of ''a'' and ''b'', while ''w2'' is the bitwise
  OR of ''a'' and ''b''. ''w'' will be set to the value of ''w1'' when ''sel'' is
  high, and the value of ''w2'' when ''sel'' is low.'
interface: module wire_drive_demo (input  a, input b, input sel, output w, output
  w1, output w2);
